We employed datasets encompassing various domains, including social media, tourism, pet services, and e-commerce.

The first dataset is from the Yelp public dataset challenge, which is a collection of user reviews and other related details from the Yelp platform. 
It involves structured features such as user-generated numerical details, including review counts and average ratings, and unstructured elements represented by the review texts.
Next is the Melbourne Airbnb Open dataset, which gives a detailed insight into Airbnb listings in Melbourne, Australia. 
It encompasses structured details like price, number of reviews, review scores, and unstructured data in the listing descriptions and host information.
Following this, the PetFinder.my Adoption Prediction dataset offers structured information detailing the numerical and categorical characteristics of pet listings, in addition to unstructured data captured in the pet descriptions penned by the caretakers.
Lastly, the Women’s E-Commerce Clothing Reviews dataset comprises customer reviews and ratings of women’s clothes sold online, including structured data such as age, rating, and categorical details like department and class name. 
It also contains unstructured data, which comes as detailed review texts.
